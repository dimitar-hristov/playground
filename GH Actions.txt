Three ways to execure GH actions
	- Docker container actions
	- JavaScript actions
	- Composite actions
	
Using dockerfile
	- Use the probot adapter again
	- Use a bash script as the entrypoint to the application
	- Change the start script to do `node ./index.js`
	- Change the explicitly set cwd to /
	- Make the script executable
	
Using JavaScript actions
	1. Use the '@probot/adapter-github-actions' dependency.
	2. Rename the current index.js to be app.js
	3. Create a new index.js to contain: https://github.com/probot/adapter-github-actions#usage
	4. Use ncc

Using Composite actions
	1. Use a bash script and the GITHUB_ACTION_PATH env variable to navigate the container
	2. We can run `npm install`
	3. We can run `node index.js`
	4. We again use the adapter from above.
	5. The bash script must be executable (x permisionss).
	
User side:
	1. Need a file like https://github.com/dimitar-hristov/playground/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml
	2. Need to bump the version evey time a new version of the action is released

(!) Testing on a dummy repo will require making the action repo public
(?) Do we need to release it in the GH Market
